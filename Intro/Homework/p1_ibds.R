# The shape and size aesthetics are mostly of use in categorical variables, whereas color can also
# be informative in continuous data

# if multiple asthetics are called they will if possible be applied simultaneously

  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = carat))

# geom_col plots a discrete x variable against a continuous y variable whereas geom_bar creates a "new""
# count variable


# 3.8.1 
# question 3.8 what does the count variable on the y-axis represent in the position = "fill" example

# 2

# The problem with the graph is overplotting, many datapoints overlap. This problem can be solved by using geom_jitter() like so:

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy))

# The labs() verb allows you to edit the x and y labels and add titles, subtiltes etc into your plots
